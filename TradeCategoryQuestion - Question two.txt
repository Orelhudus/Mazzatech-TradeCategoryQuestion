Question Two:

I would add the IsPoliticallyExposed property to the ITrade interface, 
add the property handling in the Trade class constructor and, if true, 
set the value "Is Politically Exposed" to the _clientSector variable. 
Finally, I would add it to the tradecategories.xml file to handle the 
new PEP category.

For example:
<category name="PEP" sector="Politically Exposed Person" minValue="0" maxValue="0" />
